## Background

In 2022, we were tasked with moving the ChildCare.gov website from Drupal to Federalist. Since a vendor team would take over site management, we wanted to familiarize them with the Federalist platform. This wiki is a public version of that documentation.

## What this is

This wiki provides guidance for **content designers** that want to familiarize users with the Netlify CMS system. The ChildCare.gov content managers were used to a Drupal interface and customized content types. This guide helped them understand the differences between the two systems _in this implementation_.

This wiki also provides guidance for **developers** creating Federalist site that uses 1) Jekyll as the static site generator 2) Netlify CMS as the content management system, and 3) GitHub as the content workflow management. Specific configurations, such as `State Resource` and `Page redirects` are meant to demonstrate _the configuration for ChildCare.gov_.

## What this isnâ€™t

This is not a code repository.

This wiki is not intended to be a general guide for all Federalist websites. Each site needs to configure content _for its users_. Great resources on how to do this can be found at https://methods.18f.gov/
